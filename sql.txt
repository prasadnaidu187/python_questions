1.Diffrentiate DBMS and RDBMS?
------------------------------
DBMS-stands for database management system .it is a software,
that is used to define create and maintain a database and provides controlled access ti data.

RDBMS-stands for relational database management system.it is used to store and manage only the data that are in the tables.

6.diffrentiate group by and order by?
-------------------------------------
*.GROUP BY clause is applicable when we want to use aggregate functions to more than one set of rows.

*.ORDER BY clause is applicable when we want to get the data obtained by a query in the sorting order.
           

==========================================================================================================================================================================

1.What is SQL and what is it used for?
---------------------------------------
SQL stands for structure query language.SQL is language to communicate with the databases.
SQL is working with databases,inside databases data is available in table format.
SQL is standard language for accessing and manipulating the databases.

-->it is used to storing and managing the data in RDBMS.


2.What is a database?
---------------------
organized collection of structured information stored in computer.

 					(or)
The required data can be stored in a perticular format into the computer.

3.who uses SQL?
---------------
-->developers
-->data scientists
-->business proffessionals
-->accountants etc..

4.which companies are using sql?
--------------------------------
-->google
-->netflix
-->uber
-->facebook

5.what is a DDL and DML?
------------------------
These two are commands in SQL.DDL stands for data definition language.DML stands for data manipulating language.
inside the DDL create,alter,drop,truncate,rename these commands are there.
inside the DML select,update,delete,insert these are there.


6.diffrentiate delete,drop and truncate?
----------------------------------------
DELETE:removes rows from the table
-------

DROP:removes a tables from the database.
-----

TRUNCATE:at a time it remove all rows from a table.
--------

7.what are the datatypes in SQL?
--------------------------------
*.Binary-images

*.NUmeric-float

*.strings-char,varchar,text

*.Date and time-date,time,date time
 
these all datatypes are not supported in  sql only few are there...

*.integer
*.float
*.char
*.varchar(size)
*.date
*.time
*.date time

8.what are constraints and their types?
---------------------------------------
SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in table.

*.NOT NULL:Ensure that column cannot have an null values.
----------

*.PRIMARY KEY: A combination of a not null and unique.uniquly identifies each row.
--------------

*.FOREIGN KEY: prevents action that would destroy links between tables.
--------------

*.CHECK: ensure that values in a column speciify a specific condition.
--------

*.DEFAULT: set a default value for a column if no value is specified .
----------

9.What is primary key?
----------------------
The primary key constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table.primary key must contain unique values and
cannot contain null values,a table have only one primary key,the primary key consists of single or multiple columns(feilds).

10.What is a foreign key?
------------------------
A foreign key is a feild  in one the table,that referce to the primary key in another table.

-->the table with the foreign key is called "child table".
-->the table with the primary key is called ""parent table.
 it maintain the referntial integrity in databse.


11.What are the components of ER diagram?
 -----------------------------------------
*.Entity-(weak entity)
*.Attribute-(key,composite,multivalued,derivied)
*.Relationships-(one to one,one to many,many to one,many to many)


12.what is an entity?
---------------------
-->An entity can be living or non-living component.
-->An entity is showcased as a rectangular in ER diagram
-->For example,student study cource,here both student and cource are entities.

  (i).Weak entity
  ----------------
  -->An entity that relies over the another entity is called "Weak entity".
  -->The weak entity is showcased as double rectangular in ER diagram. 


13.What is Attribute?
---------------------
-->An attribute that describes the property of an entity.
-->An entity is represented as oval shape in ER diagram.

  (i).KEY Attribute
  ------------------
  *.key attribute uniquely identifies an entity from an entity set.
  *.The text of key attribute is underlined
  *.For example,student roll number can be uniquely identify a student from a set of students.

  (ii).Composite attribute
  -------------------------
  *.An attribute that is composed of other attributes is known as "composite attributes".
  *.The composite attribute is represented with oval and that attribute is further connected with other ovals.

  (iii).Multivalued attributes 
  -----------------------------
  -->An attribute that can process more than one value,such attributes are called "Multivalued attributes".
  -->The double oval is used to represent a multivalued attribute.


  (iv).Derived Attributes 
   ----------------------
  -->An attribute that can be extracetd from other attributes of the entity is known as "derived attributes".
  -->In ER diagram,derived attributes represented by dashed oval.


14.List the diffrence types of relationship?
--------------------------------------------
-->A relationship is showcased by diamond  shape in ER diagram.
-->it shows the relationship among the entities.


  (i).one to one relationship
  ----------------------------
   -->When a single element of entity is associated with single elemnet of another entity is called "one to one relationship".
   -->For example, a student has only one identification card and an identification card is given to one person.

  (ii).one to many relationship
  ------------------------------
  -->when a single element of entity is associated with more than one element of another entity that is called "one to many relationship".
  -->For example,a customer can place many orders but an order cannot placed by many customers.
 
  (iii)Many to one relationship
  ------------------------------
  -->More than one element of entity is related with a single element of another entity then it is called "Many to one relationship".
  -->For example,students enrolls for only one cource,but a cource have many students.

  (iv).many to many relationship
  -------------------------------
  -->When more than one element of an entity is associated with the more than one element of another entity that is called "Many to Many relationship".
  -->For example, an employee can be assigned to many preojects and project can have many employees.



15.what are the diffrences between entities and relationships?
--------------------------------------------------------------
Entity:
-------
*.entity is a living or non-living component.
*.An entity is showcased as a rectangular in ER diagram
*.entities is only one type "weak entity".


Relationship:
-------------
*.it shows the relationship among the entities.
*.A relationship is showcased by diamond  shape in ER diagram.
*.An entity is four types(one to one,one to many,many to one,many to many)

18.What are the aggregate functions?
-------------------------------------
*.count():count function is used to count the how much data is available in the certain column.
----------

*.sum():sum function is used to add the data like avrages,salarys etc..
--------

*.avarages():we want only certain avarage in the table by using this one we can find out that.
-----------

*.min():By using min function we can find the min salary,age,marks these types of data we can retrieve.
--------

*.max():By using max function we can find the min salary,age,marks these types of data we can retrieve. 
--------

19.How many times of constraints we have?
-----------------------------------------
*.domain constraint-not null,check,default(fixed)

*.entity integrity constraint-unique,primary key

*.referntial integrity constarints-foreign key

20.what is data integrity?
--------------------------
data integrity is referce to accuracy and contain data
ex:a person is trying to insert the ph number into the data feild.


21.What is Normallization,Denormallization?
-------------------------------------------
-->The normallization is process to eliminating the data.
-->The denormallization is process to combine the data.


22.What is the diffrence between the group by clause and having clause?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
group by:The group by statement group the records into summary rows and returns one record from each group.
---------

having by:The having clause in SQL operates on grouped records and return rows where aggriagte function results matched with given continously only.
----------

23.What are the joins in SQL?
-----------------------------
SQL join statement is used to combine the rows of the data from two or more tables based on common column(between) them.
SQL joins are can be devided into four types 

  (i).INNER OR EQUI JOIN
 ------------------------
  inside the table what data  is same in two tables that data only can retrieve is called "INNER JOIN".

  (ii).LEFT JOIN
 ----------------
  SQL left join statement returns all the rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.

  (iii)RIGHT JOIN
 -----------------
  SQL right join statement returns all the rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.

  (iv).FULL JOIN 
 ---------------
  SQL full outer join statement returns all the rows when there is match in either left or right table.

  (v).CROSS OR CARTESSION JOIN
 ------------------------------
  By using the join it will do cross the table data.


24.What is a sub query and how it works?
-----------------------------------------
A sub query is a select quey that is enclosed inside another query.
The inner select query is usually  used to determine the results of the outer select Query.

work:
-----
-->frist inner query excuted.
-->inner query gives some result.
-->the output of inner query is substituted in outer query.
-->On excution,the outer query gives the result

25.What are the diffrent types of sub queries?
----------------------------------------------
*.subqueries with the select statement
*.subqueries with the update statement
*.subqueries with the delete statement
*.subqueries with the insert statement

26.What are triggers in SQL?
----------------------------
A trigger is user-defined SQL command that is invoked automatically in responce to an event such as insert,delete,update.


27.diffrentiate the group by and order by?
-------------------------------------
*.GROUP BY clause is applicable when we want to use aggregate functions to more than one set of rows.

*.ORDER BY clause is applicable when we want to get the data obtained by a query in the sorting order.
